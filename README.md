### 💡 About Me
Welcome to my learning playground 👋  
I’m a curious Business Analyst who enjoys learning by doing.  
I like exploring data, understanding how systems work, and experimenting with different ways to turn raw information into insights that make sense.
This GitHub is a space where I practise, learn, and grow.  
You’ll find hands-on projects exploring real-world business questions using practical tools and real data.
I’m always learning, and I see each project as an opportunity to improve my thinking, my analysis, and how I communicate insights.
